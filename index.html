                    <h2 class="section-title">Relating Lessons to Current Self</h2>
                </div>                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        Throughout my journey of understanding the self, I have learned that who I am today is the result of many layers: biological makeup, cultural background, personal experiences, and ongoing development. Each topic we explored in class offered me a lens to understand different parts of myself, and when I reflect on these lessons, I see how deeply they connect to my current identity, behavior, and values.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Perspectives of the Self</h3>
                    <p>
                        Learning different perspectives (philosophical, psychological, and sociological) helped me understand that my sense of self is not fixed but shaped by both internal and external factors. The idea that the self is constructed through experiences resonates with me because I can trace how my thoughts, behaviors, and identity have evolved depending on my environment, responsibilities, and relationships.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Biological Influences</h3>
                    <p>
                        Studying biological influences reminded me that some aspects of who I am (such as my level of energy, temperament, and stress response) are rooted in my physiology. Understanding this helped me become more patient with myself, especially when dealing with pressure. Instead of seeing reactions as flaws, I now recognize that biology plays a role, and this awareness helps me regulate my behavior better.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Body Image</h3>
                    <p>
                        The topic on body image made me reflect on how my physical self affects my confidence and social interactions. I realized that my body image has shifted over time, and although I try to stay confident, societal standards still influence me. This module helped me become more accepting of myself, appreciating my body not only for appearance but for function and health.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>
                        Learning theories on personality helped me understand my consistency in certain traits. For example, people often describe me as caring, dependable, and someone who communicates well (traits that line up with being high in agreeableness and conscientiousness). This topic made me appreciate that while my personality guides my tendencies, I can still grow and adjust when needed.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Identity Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        The module on identity development helped me reflect on how I formed my values and sense of purpose. I realized I am still in an ongoing process of identity exploration, especially as I take on more responsibilities and think about my future. Understanding developmental stages made me more comfortable with uncertainty, knowing it is natural at this age.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Culture and Ethnicity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Culture plays a large role in how I view respect, family, and social behavior. Growing up Filipino taught me the importance of social harmony, caring for others, and maintaining good relationships (traits that showed up in how other people described me). This helped me see how deeply my cultural background shapes my behavior and motivations.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sexuality</h3>
                    <p>
                        Discussing sexuality helped me understand identity as multidimensional. It also emphasized acceptance (of myself and of others). This topic made me more open-minded and aware of how sexuality connects to self-expression, relationships, and emotional well-being.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Mental Health and Well-Being</h3>
                    <p>
                        This topic reminded me that knowing myself also means knowing how to take care of my emotional and psychological health. I realized that being someone who listens to others means I must also set boundaries and protect my own energy. Mental well-being is now something I consciously try to maintain through rest, self-reflection, and staying connected with supportive people.

                <div class="section-header">

                    <h2 class="section-title">Summary of Interviews About Me</h2>
                </div>                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>
                        When I interviewed people about their impressions of me, a consistent pattern appeared in how they saw my personality and presence within our relationships. The people I spoke with described me as someone who genuinely cares about my friends and consistently shows that care through my actions. They emphasized that I am the type of person who listens, understands, and offers support without judgment. For them, I am someone they can approach anytime, whether they need advice, comfort, or simply someone who will hear them out.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Emotional Safety and Trust</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many also mentioned that they feel safe around me (not just physically but emotionally). They shared that my presence makes them feel comfortable expressing themselves openly. This sense of safety comes from the trust I build and the respect I show for their boundaries and feelings. My ability to be responsible and dependable was another trait they highlighted, saying that I am someone they can count on, especially during difficult or stressful situations.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Balance Between Fun and Responsibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, they also see the fun side of me. They described me as someone who knows how to enjoy the moment and make experiences enjoyable for others. They appreciate that I can be playful and engaging, but also serious and grounded when the situation calls for it. They pointed out that I know how to balance fun with boundaries (meaning I can enjoy myself without crossing limits or compromising respect for others).
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Overall Impression</h3>
                    <p>
                        Overall, the interviews revealed that I am viewed as caring, trustworthy, emotionally safe, fun, and balanced. Hearing their impressions helped me understand how my actions reflect my internal values and how the way I carry myself positively impacts the people around me.
